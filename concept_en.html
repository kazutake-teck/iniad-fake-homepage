        <h1>Concept of <span class="iniad">INIAD</span></h1>
        <h2>The main concept is “networking.”</h2>
        <p>Present-day society thrives thanks to advances in science and technology including computers and the Internet. We are entering an age when a single person cannot understand everything and make everything work.<br>
      What is sought today is cooperation and networking among as many people as possible.</p>
        <h2>Today’s Internet society makes it even easier to take on new challenges in the world arena.</h2>
        <p>The Internet has eliminated geographical barriers, making it easy for like-minded people to know each other and work together.<br>
      It is possible to collaborate with people who are far away (cloud sourcing), or to send a design drawing of an object and request for its manufacture and delivery by courier service. Attractive prototypes created in this manner can raise funds from all over the world via the Internet (crowdfunding). There are an increasing number of “startups” worldwide that have succeeded in bringing innovative products to the world in this manner.</p>
        <h2>If various functions and services available online are linked to work together…</h2>
        <p>Diverse functional blocks can be obtained from the Internet easily, and the development environment for smartphone has improved. Through the combination of only a few programs, it will be possible to develop sophisticated applications and offer new services.</p>
        <h2>The foundation of such networking is computer science.</h2>
